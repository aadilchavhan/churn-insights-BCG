# **Churn Insights – BCG**
### 🚀 Predicting Customer Churn Using Data Science

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes customer churn for **PowerCo**, a gas and electricity utility. The goal is to understand **price sensitivity**, determine its impact on churn, and develop a **machine learning model** to predict customers at risk of leaving.

## **Key Objectives**
✔️ Perform **exploratory data analysis** to uncover customer churn patterns  
✔️ Investigate **price sensitivity** as a churn driver  
✔️ Engineer meaningful **features** for predictive modeling  
✔️ Train a **Random Forest classifier** to predict churn  
✔️ Deliver **data-driven insights** to improve customer retention  

## **Dataset Details**
We analyze three datasets provided by PowerCo:  
- **Customer Data** – Information on customer usage, tenure, and forecasted energy consumption  
- **Pricing Data** – Fixed and variable pricing details over time  
- **Churn Indicators** – Labels indicating whether each customer has churned or remained  

## **Techniques Used**
📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualizations using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**  
⚡ **Feature Engineering** – Developed new features, including **off-peak price variations** across months  
🌲 **Machine Learning (Classification)** – Built a **Random Forest classifier** with **85% accuracy** in predicting churn  
📈 **Model Evaluation** – Assessed precision, recall, and feature importance  


## **Results & Insights**
🔹 **Price sensitivity influences churn**, but service quality and contract flexibility also impact customer decisions  
🔹 **Customers experiencing significant off-peak price variations** (Dec-Jan) show **higher churn rates**  
🔹 **Random Forest performed well**, achieving **85% accuracy** in identifying churn-prone customers  

## **Next Steps**
🔍 **Hyperparameter tuning** – Optimize the model for better precision  
📊 **Explore alternative models** – Compare Random Forest with **XGBoost or Logistic Regression**  
📢 **Develop retention strategies** – Identify the most at-risk customer segments
